 *  - `bluetoothSetup`: A bluetooth connection is not established. Scan and connect to a BLE device.
 *  - `sensorSetup`: Calibrate the sensor to before displaying measurements. This essentially tares the sensor.
 *  - `training`: After setup the device can be used for training. Here we display sensor data.
